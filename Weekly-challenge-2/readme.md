Develop a Python script that analyzes data from digital marketing campaigns to optimize the allocation of budget across various channels to maximize ROI (Return on Investment). 


The script should take into account the performance metrics of each channel (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate, and cost per acquisition) and the constraints on the total budget. 

Additionally, generate visualizations to display the performance metrics of each channel and the proposed budget allocations. Share your GitHub solution in the comments to participate.
